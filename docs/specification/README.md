# IDE Features Specification

This directory contains specifications of planned Enso IDE releases. Each specification should
allow planning and estimating implementation of required features. 

##### Planned Releases:
* [Community Release](./community-release.md)
* [Business Release](./business-release.md) (specification in progress)

### Note about Estimates

Each estimate in this document is expressed in _development days_ which is roughly the number of 
8-hours working days a senior developer need to deliver this feature **assuming he does not
work on anything else**. So the estimate includes developing, dev-testing, writing unit test and
review of another developer. It should contain also the buffer for possible unexpected problems
related to the feature. The estimate does not include design talks, meetings, fixing old bugs, etc.

[This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_FfeCXc7TZESKsrfHFihaCWDOz-LBVQNLYsTv_ptXhc/edit#gid=1520864697) 
may be used if you need express the time required for some set of features in the real team sprints.
